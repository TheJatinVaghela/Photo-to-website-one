          Our beef, chicken and turkey are raised without antibiotics and never
          given added hormones. They are never fed animal byproducts. Our
          nitrate-free, uncured bacon comes from pigs that are never given any
          antibiotics or hormones and are vegetarian fed. We only use
          ingredients that we would serve our own families. We do the worrying –
          so you don’t have to.
