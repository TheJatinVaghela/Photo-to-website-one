                Born more than 40 years ago as Mr. Natural's Good Food Store,
                we're still Missoula's home for locally-produced, organic and
                bulk foods. Now our name's a little shorter. And the storeâ€™s a
                lot bigger. But our mission remains the same:
              </span>
              <a className="HeroD_D2_D_a" href="">Read More</a>
            </div>
            <div className="HeroD_D2_D HeroD_D2_2">
               <span className="HeroD_D2_D_Span colorGrey BOY">
                The Good Food Store is dedicated to supporting a healthy
                community. We provide a wide selection of organic food and natural
                products, conduct our business in an ethical and respectful manner
                and donate to organizations in need.
